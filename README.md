# Final project
Using Machine Learning to predict cervix cancer risk

## Rationale

ML is on its way to become a powerful dyagnostic tool. Unitl then, it can be used to determine where to focus screening efforts.
In this project I try to predict the risk of having a positive cervical cancer biopsy using survey infromation regarding potential risk factors. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 Venezuelan patients. 


## Content
There are two directories Code and Data.

### Code: 

  cervix_project_1. Data_preparation. Data splitting, cleaning and LogisticRegression
  
  cervix_project_2.Model_design_1. Testing a neural network model to predict the results of a biopsy
  
  cervix_project_2.Model_design_2. Set initial bias to train the model
  
  cervix_project_2.Model_design_3. Using SMOTE to balance dataset
  
### Data:

kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv.
csv file downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/cervical-cancer-risk-classification). The dataset is originally from Venezuela (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29)
