# Final project
Using Machine Learning to predict cervix cancer risk

## Rationale

ML is on its way to become a powerful dyagnostic tool. Unitl then, it can be used to determine were to focus screening efforts.
In this project I try to predict the risk of having a positive cervical cancer biopsy using survey infromation regarding potential risk factors.


## Content
There are two directories Code and Data.

### Code: 

  cervix_project_1. Data_preparation. Data sppliting, cleaning and LinearRegression
  
  cervix_project_2.Model_testing. Testing more complex models to predict the results of a biopsy
  
  
  
### Data:

kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv.
csv file downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/cervical-cancer-risk-classification):
